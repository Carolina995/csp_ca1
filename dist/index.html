                            <p id="1"><strong>Space Exploration Technologies Corp. </strong> (doing business as <strong>SpaceX</strong>) is an American aerospace manufacturer, a provider of space 
                                transportation services, and a communications corporation headquartered in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX was founded in 2002 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk"> Elon Musk </a>
                                with the goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars. SpaceX manufactures the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy 
                                launch vehicles, several rocket engines, Cargo Dragon, crew spacecraft, and Starlink communications satellites.

                        <p id="2"><strong>SpaceX's</strong> achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach orbit around Earth, the first private
                            company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft, the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space 
                            Station, the first vertical take-off and vertical propulsive landing for an orbital rocket, the first reuse of an orbital rocket, and the first
                            private company to send astronauts to orbit and to the International Space Station. SpaceX has flown the Falcon 9 series of rockets over one 
                            hundred times.
                            SpaceX is developing a satellite internet constellation named Starlink to provide commercial internet service. In January 2020, the Starlink 
                            constellation became the largest satellite constellation ever launched, and as of March 2022 it comprises 2,112 satellites in orbit. The company
                            is also developing Starship, a privately funded, fully reusable, super heavy-lift launch system for interplanetary spaceflight. Starship is 
                            intended to become SpaceX's primary orbital vehicle once operational, supplanting the existing Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon fleet. 
                            Starship will have the highest payload capacity of any orbital rocket ever built on its debut, scheduled for 2022.

                    <h2>History</h2>
                        <h3>2001–2004: Founding</h3>
            
                        <p id="3">In 2001, Elon Musk conceptualized <em>Mars Oasis</em>, a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse and grow plants on Mars, in an attempt to 
                            revive public interest in space exploration.<sup>[7]</sup> Musk traveled to Moscow, Russia with Mike Griffin and tried to purchase cheap and refurbished
                            Dnepr rockets but returned empty-handed after failing to find rockets for an affordable price.<sup>[8][9]</sup> On the flight home Musk realized that he 
                            could start a company to build the affordable rockets he needed instead.[9] By applying vertical integration,<sup>[8]</sup> using cheap commercial
                            off-the-shelf components when possible,<sup>[9]</sup> and adopting the modular approach of modern software engineering, Musk believed SpaceX could 
                            significantly cut launch price.<sup>[9]</sup>
                            In early 2002, Musk started to look for staff for his new space company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached rocket engineer Tom Mueller
                            (later SpaceX's CTO of propulsion) and invited him to become his business partner. Mueller agreed to work for Musk, and thus SpaceX was born.<sup>[10]</sup>
                            SpaceX was first headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California. Early SpaceX employees such as Tom Mueller (CTO), Gwynne Shotwell (COO)
                            and Chris Thompson (VP of Operations) came from neighboring TRW and Boeing corporations following the cancellation of the Brilliant Pebbles 
                            program.<sup>[11]</sup> By November 2005, the company had 160 employees.<sup>[12]</sup> Musk personally interviewed and approved all of SpaceX's early employees.<sup>[13]</sup>
                            Musk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access to space, ultimately by a 
                            factor of ten.<sup>[14]</sup>
            
                        </p>        
                        <h3>2005–2009: Falcon 1 and first orbital launches</h3>
            
                        <p id="4">SpaceX developed its first orbital launch vehicle, the Falcon 1, with private funding.<sup>[15][16]</sup> The Falcon 1 was an expendable two-stage-to-orbit
                            small-lift launch vehicle. The total development cost of Falcon 1 was approximately US$90 million<sup>[17]</sup> to US$100 million.<sup>[18]</sup>
                            In 2005, SpaceX announced plans to pursue a human-rated commercial space program through the end of the decade, a program that would later become
                            the Dragon spacecraft.<sup>[19]</sup> In 2006, the company was selected by NASA to provide crew and cargo resupply demonstration contracts to the ISS under
                            the COTS program.<sup>[20]</sup>
                        
                        </p>

                        </figure>
            
                        <p id="5">The first two Falcon 1 launches were purchased by the United States Department of Defense under a program that evaluates new US launch vehicles
                            suitable for use by DARPA.<sup>[16][21][22]</sup> The first three launches of the rocket, between 2006 and 2008, all resulted in failures, which almost 
                            ended the company. Financing for Tesla Motors had failed as well,<sup>[23]</sup> and consequently Tesla, SolarCity, and Musk personally were all nearly 
                            bankrupt at the same time.<sup>[24]</sup> Musk was reportedly "waking from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain" because of the stress.<sup>[25]</sup>
                            The financial situation started to turn around when the first successful launch was achieved soon afterward with the fourth attempt on 28
                            September 2008. Musk split his remaining $30 million between SpaceX and Tesla, and NASA awarded the first Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) 
                            contract to SpaceX in December, thus financially saving the company.<sup>[26]</sup> Based on these factors and the further business operations they enabled,
                            the Falcon 1 was soon retired following its second successful, and fifth total, launch in July 2009; this allowed SpaceX to focus company 
                            resources on the development of a larger orbital rocket, the Falcon 9.<sup>[27]</sup> Gwynne Shotwell was also promoted to company president at this time,
                            for her role in successfully negotiating the CRS contract with NASA.<sup>[28]</sup>
                        
                        </p>
                        <h3>2010–2012: Falcon 9, Dragon, and NASA contracts</h3>
            
                        <p id="6">SpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity vehicle, the Falcon 5.<sup>[29]</sup> The company 
                            instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of the Falcon 9, a reusable heavier lift vehicle. Development of the Falcon 9 was 
                            accelerated by NASA, which committed to purchase several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. This started with seed
                            money from the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006.<sup>[30]</sup> The overall contract award was US$278 million to provide 
                            development funding for the Dragon spacecraft, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon.[30] As part of this contract, the 
                            Falcon 9 launched for the first time in June 2010 with the Dragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit, using a mockup of the Dragon spacecraft.
                            The first operational Dragon spacecraft was launched in December 2010 aboard COTS Demo Flight 1, the Falcon 9's second flight, and safely 
                            returned to Earth after two orbits, completing all its mission objectives.<sup>[31]</sup> By December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one
                            Falcon 9 and Dragon every three months.<sup>[32]</sup>

                        <p id="7">In April 2011, as part of its second-round Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, NASA issued a US$75 million contract for SpaceX to 
                            develop an integrated launch escape system for Dragon in preparation for human-rating it as a crew transport vehicle to the ISS.<sup>[33]</sup> NASA awarded
                            SpaceX a fixed-price Space Act Agreement (SAA) to produce a detailed design of the crew transportation system in August 2012.<sup>[34]</sup>
                            In early 2012, approximately two-thirds of SpaceX stock was owned by Musk<sup>[35]</sup> and his 70 million shares were then estimated to be worth US$875 
                            million on private markets,<sup>[36]</sup> valuing SpaceX at US$1.3 billion.<sup>[37]</sup> In May 2012, with the Dragon C2+ launch Dragon became the first commercial
                            spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station.<sup>[38]</sup> After the flight, the company private equity valuation nearly doubled to 
                            US$2.4 billion or US$20/share.<sup>[39][40]</sup> By that time, SpaceX had operated on total funding of approximately $1 billion over its first decade of 
                            operation. Of this, private equity provided approximately $200 million, with Musk investing approximately $100 million and other investors 
                            having put in about $100 million.<sup>[41]</sup>
                            SpaceX's active reusability test program began in late 2012 with testing low-altitude, low-speed aspects of the landing technology.<sup>[42]</sup> The 
                            Falcon 9 prototypes performed vertical takeoffs and landings (VTOL). High-velocity, high-altitude tests of the booster atmospheric return 
                            technology began in late 2013.<sup>[42]</sup>

                        <h3>2013–2015: Commercial launches and rapid growth</h3>
            
                        <p id="8">SpaceX launched the first commercial mission for a private customer in 2013. In 2014, SpaceX won nine contracts out of the 20 that were 
                            openly competed worldwide.<sup>[43]</sup> That year Arianespace requested that European governments provide additional subsidies to face the competition
                            from SpaceX.<sup>[44][45]</sup> Beginning in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and pricing also began to affect the market for launch of U.S. military payloads,
                            which for nearly a decade was dominated by the large U.S. launch provider United Launch Alliance (ULA).<sup>[46]</sup> The monopoly had allowed launch

                        <p id="9">Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contract to finalize the development of the Crew Transportation System. The contract included several 
                            technical and certification milestones, an uncrewed flight test, a crewed flight test, and six operational missions after certification.<sup>[34]</sup>
                            In January 2015, SpaceX raised US$1 billion in funding from Google and Fidelity, in exchange for 8.33% of the company, establishing the 
                            company valuation at approximately US$12 billion.<sup>[48]</sup> The same month SpaceX announced the development of a new satellite constellation, called
                            Starlink, to provide global broadband internet service with 4,000 satellites.<sup>[49]</sup>
                            The Falcon 9 had its first major failure in late June 2015, when the seventh ISS resupply mission, CRS-7 exploded two minutes into the 
                            flight. 
                            The problem was traced to a failed 2-foot-long steel strut that held a helium pressure vessel, which broke free due to the force of 
                            acceleration. This caused a breach and allowed high-pressure helium to escape into the low-pressure propellant tank, causing the failure.<sup>[50]</sup>

                            launch static fire test. The payload, the Amos-6 communications satellite valued at US$200 million, was destroyed.<sup>[54]</sup> The explosion was caused
                            by the liquid oxygen that is used as propellant turning so cold that it solidified and ignited with carbon composite helium vessels.<sup>[55]</sup> Though
                            not considered an unsuccessful flight, the rocket explosion sent the company into a four-month launch hiatus while it worked out what went 
                            wrong. SpaceX returned to flight in January 2017.<sup>[56]</sup>
                            Later that year, in March 2017, SpaceX launched a returned Falcon 9 for the SES-10 satellite. This was the first time a re-launch of a payload-
                            carrying orbital rocket went back to space.<sup>[57]</sup> The first stage was recovered again, also making it the first landing of a reused orbital class

                        <p id="12">In July 2017, the company raised US$350 million for a valuation of US$21 billion.<sup>[59]</sup> In 2017, SpaceX achieved a 45% global market share for
                            awarded commercial launch contracts.<sup>[60]</sup> By March 2018, SpaceX had more than 100 launches on its manifest representing about US$12 billion 
                            in contract revenue.<sup>[61]</sup> The contracts included both commercial and government (NASA/DOD) customers.<sup>[62]</sup> This made SpaceX the leading global
                            commercial launch provider measured by manifested launches.<sup>[63]</sup>
                            In 2017, SpaceX formed a subsidiary, The Boring Company,[64] and began work to construct a short test tunnel on and adjacent to the SpaceX 
                            and manufacturing facility, utilizing a small number of SpaceX employees,<sup>[65]</sup> which was completed in May 2018,<sup>[66]</sup> and opened to 
                            the public in December 2018.<sup>[67]</sup> During 2018, The Boring Company was spun out into a separate corporate entity with 6% of the equity going to 
                            SpaceX, less than 10% to early employees, and the remainder of the equity to Elon Musk.<sup>[67]</sup>

                        <p id="13">In January 2019 SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce in order to help finance the Starship and Starlink projects.<sup>[68]</sup> 
                            Construction of initial prototypes and tests for Starship started in early 2019 in Florida and Texas. All Starship construction and testing 
                            moved to the new SpaceX South Texas launch site later that year. In May 2019 SpaceX also launched the first large batch of 60 Starlink 
                            satellites, beginning the deployment of what would become the world's largest commercial satellite constellation the following year.<sup>[69] </sup>The
                            company raised a total of US$1.33 billion of capital across three funding rounds in 2019.<sup>[70]</sup> By May 2019, the valuation of SpaceX had risen
                            to US$33.3 billion<sup>[71]</sup> and reached US$36 billion by March 2020.<sup>[72]</sup>
                            A major milestone was achieved in May 2020, when SpaceX successfully launched two NASA astronauts (Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken) into orbit on
                            a Crew Dragon spacecraft during Crew Dragon Demo-2, making SpaceX the first private company to send astronauts to the International Space 
                            Station and marking the first crewed orbital launch from American soil in 9 years.<sup>[73][74]</sup> The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center

                        <p id="15">SpaceX has developed three launch vehicles. The small-lift Falcon 1 was the first launch vehicle developed and was retired in 2009. The 
                            medium-lift Falcon 9 and the heavy-lift Falcon Heavy are both operational. The Falcon 1 was a small rocket capable of placing several
                            hundred kilograms into low Earth orbit. It launched five times between 2006 and 2009, of which 2 were successful.<sup>[95]</sup> The Falcon 1 was the 
                            first privately funded, liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit.<sup>[83]</sup>
                            Falcon 9 is a medium-lift launch vehicle capable of delivering up to 22,800 kilograms (50,265 lb) to orbit, competing with the Delta IV 
                            and the Atlas V rockets, as well as other launch providers around the world. It has nine Merlin engines in its first stage. The Falcon 9 v1.0
                            rocket successfully reached orbit on its first attempt on 4 June 2010. Its third flight, COTS Demo Flight 2, launched on 22 May 2012, and 
                            launched the first commercial spacecraft to reach and dock with the International Space Station (ISS).<sup>[38]</sup> The vehicle was upgraded to 
                            Falcon 9 v1.1 in 2013, Falcon 9 Full Thrust in 2015, and finally to Falcon 9 Block 5 in 2018. The first stage of Falcon 9 is designed to 
                            retropropulsively land, be recovered, and reflown.<sup>[96]</sup>

                        <p id="17">Since the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company has developed several rocket engines – Merlin, Kestrel, and Raptor for use in launch 
                            vehicles,<sup>[104][105]</sup> Draco for the reaction control system of the Dragon series of spacecraft,<sup>[106]</sup> and SuperDraco for abort capability in
                            Crew Dragon.<sup>[107]</sup>
                            Merlin is a family of rocket engines that uses liquid oxygen (LOX) and RP-1 propellants in a gas-generator power cycle. Merlin was first 
                            used to power the Falcon 1's first stage and is now used on both stages of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles.<sup>[108]</sup>
                            Kestrel is a LOX/RP-1 pressure-fed rocket engine and was used as the Falcon 1 rocket's second stage main engine. It is built around the 
                            same pintle architecture as SpaceX's Merlin engine but does not have a turbopump and is fed only by tank pressure. The engine is ablatively
                            cooled in the chamber and throat and is radiatively cooled on the exhaust nozzle. The Kestrel's nozzle is fabricated from a high strength 
                            niobium alloy.<sup>[105][109]</sup>

                            Draco thrusters generate 400 N (90 lbf) of thrust,<sup>[110]</sup> and they are used on the reaction control system of the Dragon and Dragon 2 
                            spacecraft.<sup>[106]</sup> SuperDraco is more powerful, with 73 kN (16,000 lbf) of thrust. Eight SuperDraco engines provide launch escape capability
                            for crewed Dragon 2 spacecraft during an abort scenario.<sup>[111]</sup>
                            Raptor is a new family of liquid oxygen and liquid methane-fueled full-flow staged combustion cycle engines to power the first and second
                            stages of the in-development Starship launch system.<sup>[104]</sup> Development versions were test-fired in late 2016.<sup>[112]</sup> On 3 April 2019, SpaceX 
                            conducted a static fire test in Texas on its Starhopper vehicle, which ignited the engine while the vehicle remained tethered to the ground.<sup>[113] </sup>
                            In 2019, Raptor flew for the first time, powering the Starhopper vehicle to an altitude of 20 m (66 ft).
                            <sup>[114]</sup> SpaceX continues to conduct further test flights of the Starship vehicle in 2020 and 2021.<sup>[115]</sup>

                            used only for cargo, was first launched in 2010.<sup>[31]</sup> The currently operational second generation Dragon spacecraft, known as Dragon 2, conducted 
                            its first flight, without crew, to the ISS in early 2019, followed by a crewed flight of Dragon 2 in 2020.<sup>[73]</sup> The cargo variant of Dragon 2 
                            flew for the first time in December 2020, for a resupply to the Space Station as part of the CRS contract with NASA.<sup>[116]</sup>

                            SpaceX also plans to introduce floating launch platforms. These are modified oil rigs to use in the 2020s to provide a sea launch option
                            for their second-generation launch vehicle: the heavy-lift Starship system, consisting of the Super Heavy booster and Starship second

                            costs. The rocket burns liquid oxygen and liquid methane, with its structure divided into two stages: a Super Heavy booster and the Starship
                            spacecraft. Visibly, the spacecraft has four extruding flaps; they are used for controlling while in atmospheric entry and descent phases. 
                            The spacecraft can be specialized into several variants, either for hosting cargo, crew, propellant, or landing on the Moon. As a result, 
                            Starship is involved in several projects, including the Artemis program and the dearMoon project. Possible future projects include colonizing 
                            Mars and rapid transport between locations on Earth.

                            pointed upright, the Super Heavy booster fires thirty-three Raptor engines and lifts itself into space. After separation, the Starship 
                            spacecraft fires three Raptor Vacuum engines and inserts itself into orbit. Meanwhile, the booster takes control while descending through 
                            the atmosphere by attached grid fins. Later, it fires many rocket engines downwards, caught by the launch tower's arms, and positioned to the
                            starting launch mount. For the spacecraft, at the end of the mission, it enters the atmosphere, glides toward the landing site, fires three 
                            Raptor engines, and lands vertically on a pad.
                            Early concepts for a launch vehicle like Starship were first outlined by SpaceX as early as 2005, with frequent design changes as concepts
                            matured towards development and production. In July 2019, a prototype vehicle named Starhopper performed a 150 m (490 ft) low altitude 
                            test flight, as it is powered by a single Raptor engine. After four failed attempts, in May 2021, the complete Starship SN15 flew to 10 km 
                            (6 mi), transitioned to horizontal free fall, and landed successfully for the first time. As of March 2022, Starship rocket will do its first
                            spaceflight in early 2022.

                        <p id="26">The planned large number of Starlink satellites has been criticized by astronomers due to concerns over light pollution,<sup>[130][131][132]</sup> with the
                            brightness of Starlink satellites in both optical and radio wavelengths interfering with scientific observations.<sup>[133]</sup> In response, SpaceX has 
                            implemented several upgrades to Starlink satellites aimed at reducing their brightness during operation.<sup>[134]</sup> The large number of satellites 
                            employed by Starlink also creates long-term dangers of space debris collisions resulting from placing thousands of satellites in orbit.<sup>[135][136] </sup>
                            However the satellites are equipped with krypton-fueled Hall thrusters which allow them to de-orbit at the end of their life. Additionally,
                            the satellites are designed to autonomously avoid collisions based on uplinked tracking data.<sup>[137]</sup> Commentators, such as Shannon Stirone, have used 
                            Starlink and light pollution as an example of what she perceives to be the irresponsible attitude of companies in Silicon Valley.<sup>[138]</sup>

                        <p id="27">In June 2015 SpaceX announced that they would sponsor a Hyperloop competition, and would build a 1.6 km (0.99 mi) long subscale test track
                            near SpaceX's headquarters for the competitive events.<sup>[139][140]</sup> The company has held the annual competition since 2017.<sup>[141]</sup>
                            In collaboration with doctors and academic researchers, SpaceX invited all employees to participate in the creation of a COVID-19 antibody-
                            testing program in 2020. As such 4300 employees volunteered to provide blood-samples resulting in a peer-reviewed scientific paper crediting eight
                            SpaceX employees as coauthors and suggesting that a certain level of COVID-19 antibodies may provide lasting protection against the virus.<sup>[142][143]</sup>

                        <p id="29">SpaceX Headquarters is located in the Los Angeles suburb of Hawthorne, California. The large three-story facility, originally built by 
                            Northrop Corporation to build Boeing 747 fuselages,<sup>[144]</sup> houses SpaceX's office space, mission control, and Falcon 9 manufacturing facilities.<sup>[147]</sup>
                            The area has one of the largest concentrations of aerospace headquarters, facilities, and/or subsidiaries in the U.S., including Boeing/McDonnell 
                            Douglas main satellite building campuses, Aerospace Corp., Raytheon, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, United States Space Force's Space and Missile

                        <p id="32">The company purchased the McGregor facilities from Beal Aerospace, where it refitted the largest test stand for Falcon 9 engine testing. 
                            SpaceX has made a number of improvements to the facility since purchase and has also extended the acreage by purchasing several pieces of 
                            adjacent farmland. As of October 2012, the McGregor facility had seven test stands that are operated "18 hours a day, six days a week"<sup>[149]</sup>
                            and is building more test stands because production is ramping up and the company has a large manifest in the next several years.<sup>[150]</sup> In 
                            addition to routine testing, Dragon capsules (following recovery after an orbital mission), are shipped to McGregor for de-fueling, cleanup,
                            and refurbishment for reuse in future missions.<sup>[151]</sup>

                        <p id="33">SpaceX currently operates three orbital launch sites, at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Vandenberg Space Force Base, and Kennedy 
                            Space Center, with another under construction near Brownsville, Texas. SpaceX has indicated that they see a niche for each of the four 
                            orbital facilities and that they have sufficient launch business to fill each pad.<sup>[152]</sup> The Vandenberg launch site enables highly inclined 
                            orbits (66–145°), while Cape Canaveral enables orbits of medium inclination (28.5–51.6°).<sup>[153]</sup> Before it was retired, all Falcon 1 launches 
                            took place at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on Omelek Island.<sup>[154]</sup>
